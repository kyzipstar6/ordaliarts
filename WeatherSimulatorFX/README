Simulate real weather as you wish with this Weather Simulator. To run the .jar file. Push at least in a folder named "Weather
Simulator FX" the folowing files and folders:

- Stages (contains some background images and app-text)
 -runhistory (so you can use "Data writting" feature).
- WeatherSimulatorFX.jar 

Copy the folder to your Documents direcory. Then create a shortcut in your desktop to set quick access to the application.

Optional you can download i.ico and set a custom .ico art by changing your created shortcut'S image.

If you think you can inprove this Simulator by creating new models or adding to the Application new features or media, you
are keenly welcome. That is why I am sharing with you the src folder.

Let me know any observations on the models or if you would like to add any feature!
